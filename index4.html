                            Facts About My School
                        </h1>
                        <p>Started initially as Step by Step Nursery in 1996, it was only a matter of time that
                            its reputation and organic growth would lead to the conceptualisation of what is known
                            as Caelum High #The Happy School! Caelum started functioning at its brand new
                            sprawling campus at Undri, Pune in 2014, with a total of 162 students.<div style="color:red;"> 
                            Through outstanding ICSE results coupled with holistic development of all our students,
                            the good word spread and today we can proudly call ourselves one of the top ICSE
                            institutions in the country. Our strength today is close to 1000 students and that
                            number only increases every year.. The word Caelum pronounced as Kellum is a Latin
                            word which means a chisel-shaped constellation of stars. An apt name for our
                            institution, where we believe that every child is a star with a light of its own waiting
                            to be discovered. Our dedicated teachers are synonymous to the chisel and ensure that
                            they bring out the very best in every child.</div></p>
